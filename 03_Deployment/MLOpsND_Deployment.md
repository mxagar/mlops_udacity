# Machine Learning DevOps Engineer: Personal Notes on the Udacity Nanodegree

These are my notes of the [Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning DevOps Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821).

The nanodegree is composed of four modules:

1. Clean Code Principles
2. Building a Reproducible Model Workflow
3. Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
4. ML Model Scoring and Monitoring

Each module has a folder with its respective notes. This folder and file refer to the **third** module: **Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production**.
