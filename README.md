# Machine Learning DevOps Engineer: Personal Notes on the Udacity Nanodegree

These are my notes of the [Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning DevOps Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821).

The nanodegree is composed of four modules:

1. [Clean Code Principles](01_Clean_Code/MLOpsND_CleanCode.md)
2. [Building a Reproducible Model Workflow](02_Reproducible_Pipelines/MLOpsND_ReproduciblePipelines.md)
3. Deploying a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
4. ML Model Scoring and Monitoring

Each module has a folder with its respective notes; **you need to go to each module folder and follow the Markdown file in it.**

## Projects

Udacity requires the submission of a project for each module; these are the repositories of the projects I submitted:

1. Predicting Customer Churn with *Production-Level* Software: [customer_churn_production](https://github.com/mxagar/customer_churn_production).
2. A Reproducible Machine Learning Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Price Prediction in New York City: [ml_pipeline_rental_prices](https://github.com/mxagar/ml_pipeline_rental_prices).
3. Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI.
4. A Dynamic Risk Assessment System
